# aestas – Blog CMS

A long-time project of mine, that I started when I was still in school.  
After learning a lot of stuff in college – studying computer science –  
I scrapped 99% of my code and rewrote it. Hence the "version 2".

Didn't have that much time and motivation in the past few semesters.  
But this project ain't dead. Probably never will, just as it will never be finished.
